const DESC = `Get historical values of an ioBroker state (sensor values, meter readings, switch states, ...) with ready-made statistics.

The history adapter (history, sql, influxdb) that logs the state is detected automatically.
Use listHistoryStates to find states that have history.

Times are given as text, no timestamp calculation needed:
- relative: "-24h", "-7d", "-30m", "-2w", "-1mo", "-1y" (ago from now)
- calendar: "today", "yesterday", "now"
- dates in local time: "2026-10-01", "2026-10-01 08:00"
Default range is the last 24 hours. The response contains the current server time ("now") and the resolved range.
If the user names a month or day without a year, use the most recent one that has already started (e.g. "September" asked in October 2026 = 2026-09-01 to 2026-10-01). Do not ask back, state the assumed year in the answer.
Long ranges (months, a whole year) are fine: all values are loaded and summarized.

The result always has a "summary" for the whole range:
count, min, max (with time), average, timeWeightedAverage (each value weighted by how long it was valid -
use this for temperatures or on/off states, booleans count as 1/0), sum, first, last,
delta (last - first) and increase (growth of a meter, ignores resets - use this for consumption like kWh or m³).

"series" lists the values over time: raw values if they fit into "limit", otherwise per interval.
Set "interval" ("15m", "1h", "1d", "1w") and "aggregate" for values per interval, e.g. consumption per day.

Examples:
- Electricity used yesterday: getHistory({ id: "smartmeter.0.total_kwh", start: "yesterday", end: "today" }) -> summary.increase
- Consumption per day this week: getHistory({ id: "smartmeter.0.total_kwh", start: "-7d", interval: "1d", aggregate: "increase" })
- Average temperature last week: getHistory({ id: "hm-rpc.0.ABC.1.TEMPERATURE", start: "-7d" }) -> summary.timeWeightedAverage
- Hottest hour today: getHistory({ id: "...", start: "today", interval: "1h", aggregate: "max" })
- Warmest day in September: getHistory({ id: "...", start: "2026-09-01", end: "2026-10-01", interval: "1d", aggregate: "max" }) -> day with the highest value (aggregate "average" for the warmest daily mean)
- Highest temperature this year: getHistory({ id: "...", start: "2026-01-01" }) -> summary.max (value and time)
- How long was the pump on yesterday: getHistory({ id: "...pump.on", start: "yesterday", end: "today" }) -> summary.timeWeightedAverage x 24 h
